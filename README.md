# UCI graduate housing optimal choice
pick the optimal combination of apartments to save and maximize the probability of getting where you want.
obtain the best choice for your graduate application, your expected rent and the maximum you could end up paying if you end up being assigned in one of those units.

**WARNING**: the current implementation considers 2022 rent prices (not up to date) and only apartments whose rent is <800$. you can easily add other units (e.g. verano towers). the model also assumes uniform probability of vacancy, but this might not be the case for newly built units (such as, again, the verano towers).
